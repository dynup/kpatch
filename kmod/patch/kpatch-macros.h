 * by create-diff-object so that it can be declared in multiple objects that
 * are later linked together, avoiding global symbol collision.  Since multiple
 * hooks can be registered, the .kpatch.hook.load section is a table of struct
 * kpatch_load elements that will be executed in series by the kpatch core
 * module at load time, assuming the kernel object (module) is currently
 * loaded; otherwise, the hook is called when module to be patched is loaded
 * via the module load notifier.

 * code paths containing calls to printk might also be marked cold, leading to
 * other functions called in those code paths getting moved into .text.unlikely
 * or being uninlined.

 * This macro places printk in its own code path so as not to make the
 * surrounding code path cold.
