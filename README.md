kpatch: dynamic kernel patching
===============================

kpatch is a Linux dynamic kernel patching infrastructure which allows you to
patch a running kernel without rebooting or restarting any processes.  It
enables sysadmins to apply critical security patches to the kernel immediately,
without having to wait for long-running tasks to complete, for users to log
off, or for scheduled reboot windows.  It gives more control over uptime
without sacrificing security or stability.

kpatch is currently in active development.  For now, it should _not_ be used
in production environments.

**WARNING: Use with caution!  Kernel crashes, spontaneous reboots, and data loss
may occur!**

###Build

Compile kpatch:

    make

###Install

OPTIONAL: Install kpatch to /usr/local:

    sudo make install

Alternatively, the kpatch and kpatch-build scripts can be run directly from the
git tree.


Quick start
-----------

*NOTE: While kpatch is designed to work with any recent Linux
kernel on any distribution, the "kpatch-build" command currently only works on
Fedora 20 and Ubuntu 14.04.*

First, make a source code patch against the kernel tree using diff, git, or
quilt.

As a contrived example, let's patch /proc/meminfo to show VmallocChunk in ALL
CAPS so we can see it better:

    $ cat meminfo-string.patch
    Index: src/fs/proc/meminfo.c
    ===================================================================
    --- src.orig/fs/proc/meminfo.c
    +++ src/fs/proc/meminfo.c
    @@ -95,7 +95,7 @@ static int meminfo_proc_show(struct seq_
     		"Committed_AS:   %8lu kB\n"
     		"VmallocTotal:   %8lu kB\n"
     		"VmallocUsed:    %8lu kB\n"

    +		"VMALLOCCHUNK:   %8lu kB\n"
     #ifdef CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE
     		"HardwareCorrupted: %5lu kB\n"
     #endif

Build the patch module:

    $ kpatch-build -t vmlinux meminfo-string.patch
    Using cache at /home/jpoimboe/.kpatch/3.13.10-200.fc20.x86_64/src
    Testing patch file
    checking file fs/proc/meminfo.c
    Building original kernel
    Building patched kernel
    Detecting changed objects
    Rebuilding changed objects
    Extracting new and modified ELF sections
    meminfo.o: changed function: meminfo_proc_show
    Building patch module: kpatch-meminfo-string.ko
    SUCCESS

> NOTE: The `-t vmlinux` option is used to tell `kpatch-build` to only look for

That outputs a patch module named `kpatch-meminfo-string.ko` in the current
directory.  Now apply it to the running kernel:

    $ sudo kpatch load kpatch-meminfo-string.ko
    loading core module: /usr/local/lib/modules/3.13.10-200.fc20.x86_64/kpatch/kpatch.ko
    loading patch module: kpatch-meminfo-string.ko

Done!  The kernel is now patched.

    $ grep -i chunk /proc/meminfo
    VMALLOCCHUNK:   34359337092 kB

How it works
------------

kpatch works at a function granularity: old functions are replaced with new
ones.  It has four main components:

- **kpatch-build**: a collection of tools which convert a source diff patch to
  a patch module.  They work by compiling the kernel both with and without
  the source patch, comparing the binaries, and generating a patch module
  which includes new binary versions of the functions to be replaced.

- **patch module**: a kernel module (.ko file) which includes the
  replacement functions and metadata about the original functions.

- **kpatch core module**: a kernel module (.ko file) which provides an
  interface for the patch modules to register new functions for
  replacement.  It uses the kernel ftrace subsystem to hook into the original
  function's mcount call instruction, so that a call to the original function
  is redirected to the replacement function.

- **kpatch utility:** a command-line tool which allows a user to manage a
  collection of patch modules.  One or more patch modules may be
  configured to load at boot time, so that a system can remain patched
  even after a reboot into the same version of the kernel.


### kpatch-build

The "kpatch-build" command converts a source-level diff patch file to a kernel
patch module.  Most of its work is performed by the kpatch-build script
which uses a utility named `create-diff-object` to compare changed objects.

The primary steps in kpatch-build are:
- Build the unstripped vmlinux for the kernel
- Patch the source tree
- Rebuild vmlinux and monitor which objects are being rebuilt.
  These are the "changed objects".
- Recompile each changed object with `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`,
  resulting in the changed patched objects
- Unpatch the source tree
- Recompile each changed object with `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`,
  resulting in the changed original objects
- For every changed object, use `create-diff-object` to do the following:
	* Analyze each original/patched object pair for patchability
	* Add `.kpatch.funcs` and `.rela.kpatch.funcs` sections to the output object.
	The kpatch core module uses this to determine the list of functions
	that need to be redirected using ftrace.
	* Add `.kpatch.dynrelas` and `.rela.kpatch.dynrelas` sections to the output object.
	This will be used to resolve references to non-included local
	and non-exported global symbols. These relocations will be resolved by the kpatch core module.
	* Generate the resulting output object containing the new and modified sections
- Link all the output objects into a cumulative object
- Generate the patch module

### Patching

The patch modules register with the core module (`kpatch.ko`).
They provide information about original functions that need to be replaced, and
corresponding function pointers to the replacement functions.

The core module registers a handler function with ftrace.  The
handler function is called by ftrace immediately before the original
function begins executing.  This occurs with the help of the reserved mcount
call at the beginning of every function, created by the gcc `-mfentry` flag.
The ftrace handler then modifies the return instruction pointer (IP)
address on the stack and returns to ftrace, which then restores the original
function's arguments and stack, and "returns" to the new function.


Limitations
-----------

- Patches to functions which are always on the stack of at least one
  process in the system are not supported.  Examples: schedule(),
  sys_poll(), sys_select(), sys_read(), sys_nanosleep().  Attempting to
  apply such a patch will cause the insmod of the patch module to return
  an error.

- Patches which modify init functions (annotated with `__init`) are not
  supported.  kpatch-build will return an error if the patch attempts
  to do so.

- Patches which modify statically allocated data are not supported.
  kpatch-build will detect that and return an error.  (In the future
  we will add a facility to support it.  It will probably require the
  user to write code which runs at patch module loading time which manually
  updates the data.)

- Patches which change the way a function interacts with dynamically
  allocated data might be safe, or might not.  It isn't possible for
  kpatch-build to verify the safety of this kind of patch.  It's up to
  the user to understand what the patch does, whether the new functions
  interact with dynamically allocated data in a different way than the
  old functions did, and whether it would be safe to atomically apply
  such a patch to a running kernel.

- Patches which modify functions in vdso are not supported.  These run in
  user-space and ftrace can't hook them.

- Some incompatibilities currently exist between kpatch and usage of ftrace and
  kprobes.  See the Frequently Asked Questions section for more details.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Q. Isn't this just a virus/rootkit injection framework?**

kpatch uses kernel modules to replace code.  It requires the `CAP_SYS_MODULE`
capability.  If you already have that capability, then you already have the
ability to arbitrarily modify the kernel, with or without kpatch.

**Q. How can I detect if somebody has patched the kernel?**

When a patch module is loaded, the `TAINT_USER` flag is set.  To test for it,
`cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted` and check to see if the value of 64 has been
OR'ed in.

Eventually we hope to have a dedicated `TAINT_KPATCH` flag instead.

Note that the `TAINT_OOT_MODULE` flag (4096) will also be set, since the patch
module is built outside the Linux kernel source tree.

If your patch module is unsigned, the `TAINT_FORCED_MODULE` flag (2) will also
be set.  Starting with Linux 3.15, this will be changed to the more specific
`TAINT_UNSIGNED_MODULE` (8192).

**Q. Will it destabilize my system?**

No, as long as the patch is chosen carefully.  See the Limitations section
above.

**Q. Why does kpatch use ftrace to jump to the replacement function instead of
adding the jump directly?**

ftrace owns the first "call mcount" instruction of every kernel function.  In
order to keep compatibility with ftrace, we go through ftrace rather than
updating the instruction directly.  This approach also ensures that the code
modification path is reliable, since ftrace has been doing it successfully for
years.

**Q Is kpatch compatible with \<insert kernel debugging subsystem here\>?**

We aim to be good kernel citizens and maintain compatibility.  A kpatch
replacement function is no different than a function loaded by any other kernel
module.  Each replacement function has its own symbol name and kallsyms entry,
so it looks like a normal function to the kernel.

- **oops stack traces**: Yes.  If the replacement function is involved in an
  oops, the stack trace will show the function and kernel module name of the
  replacement function, just like any other kernel module function.  The oops
  message will also show the taint flag (currently `TAINT_USER`).
- **kdump/crash**: Yes.  Replacement functions are normal functions, so crash
  will have no issues.
- **ftrace**: Yes, but certain uses of ftrace which involve opening the
  `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace` file or using `trace-cmd record` can result
  in a tiny window of time where a patch gets temporarily disabled.  Therefore
  it's a good idea to avoid using ftrace on a patched system until this issue
  is resolved.
- **systemtap/kprobes**: Some incompatibilities exist.
  - If you setup a kprobe module at the beginning of a function before loading
    a kpatch module, and they both affect the same function, kprobes "wins"
    until the kprobe has been unregistered.  This is tracked in issue
    [#47](https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/issues/47).
  - Setting a kretprobe before loading a kpatch module could be unsafe.  See
    issue [#67](https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/issues/67).
- **perf**: Yes.
- **tracepoints**: Patches to a function which uses tracepoints will result in
  the tracepoints being effectively disabled as long as the patch is applied.

**Q. Why not use something like kexec instead?**

If you want to avoid a hardware reboot, but are ok with restarting processes,
kexec is a good alternative.

**Q. If an application can't handle a reboot, it's designed wrong.**

That's a good poi... [system reboots]

**Q. What changes are needed in other upstream projects?**

We hope to make the following changes to other projects:

- kernel:
	- ftrace improvements to close any windows that would allow a patch to
	  be inadvertently disabled
	- hot patch taint flag
	- possibly the kpatch core module itself

- crash:
	- point it to where the patch modules and corresponding debug symbols
	  live on the file system

**Q: Is it possible to register a function that gets called atomically with
`stop_machine` when the patch module loads and unloads?**

We do have plans to implement something like that.

**Q. What kernels are supported?**

kpatch needs gcc >= 4.6 and Linux >= 3.7 for use of the -mfentry flag.

**Q. Is it possible to remove a patch?**

Yes.  Just run `kpatch unload` which will disable and unload the patch module
and restore the function to its original state.

**Q. Can you apply multiple patches?**

Yes, but to prevent any unexpected interactions between multiple patch modules,
it's recommended that you only have a single patch loaded at any given time.
This can be achieved by combining the new patch with the previous patch using
`combinediff` before running `kpatch-build`.  You can then the `kpatch replace`
command to atomically replace the old patch module with the new cumulative one.

**Q. Why did kpatch-build detect a changed function that wasn't touched by the
source patch?**

There could be a variety of reasons for this, such as:

- The patch changed an inline function.
- The compiler decided to inline a changed function, resulting in the outer
  function getting recompiled.  This is common in the case where the inner
  function is static and is only called once.
- The function uses a WARN() or WARN_ON() macro.  These macros embed the source
  code line number (`__LINE__`) into an instruction.  If a function was changed
  higher up in the file, it will affect the line numbers for all subsequent
  WARN calls in the file, resulting in recompilation of their functions.  If
  this happens to you, you can usually just ignore it, as patching a few extra
  functions isn't typically a problem.  If it becomes a problem for whatever
  reason, you can change the source patch to redefine the WARN macro for the
  affected files, such that it hard codes the old line number instead of using
  `__LINE__`, for example.
